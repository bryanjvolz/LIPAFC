              <h1>The Heck is this?</h1>
              <p>The LIPAFC (Louisville-INDIANAPOLIS PROXIMITY&hellip; oh don't make me type it again) is the soccer rivalry between Indianapolis Eleven and Louisville City FC. As aluded above, this clash of titans is the cause for humanity&lsquo;s ascension to control this planet. Much like Bill &amp; Ted, this rivalry has spanned the ages and will some day bring peace to the world&hellip; once they learn to play guitar. While sporting celebs will tell you grand tales of Worldly Cups or Superb Owls, only the LIPAFC will tug your heartstrings like a puppy and tear you apart like finding out what happened to Bambiâ€™s mom.</p>

                <p>Every distinguished competition requires a trophy of elegance, sophistication, and equal importance. That's why the Louisville Coopers and the Brickyard Battalion keep the ultimate trophy in the soccer landscape - the LIPAFC Barrel Trophy<sup>&trade;</sup><sup>&reg;</sup></p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>The Barrel is awarded to the season's series winner. This means that The Barrel <strong>does not</strong> change hands mid-season. </li>
                    <li>In the event that the season series is split, the current holders retain possession of The Barrel.</li>
                    <li>If the teams meet in the playoffs and the series is tied, the playoff game decides the winner of The Barrel.</li>
                    <li>Each season, the winner is marked with a blue or purple carabiner that hands from the top of The Barrel.</li>
                    <li>The modern-day Barrel was created in 2022. However, an older version was rumored to have been a barrel built from the very same wood as the fabled Trojan Horse.</li>
