        <h1>The Heck is this?</h1>
        <p>The LIPAFC (Louisville-INDIANAPOLIS PROXIMITY&hellip; oh don't make me type it again) is the soccer rivalry between Indianapolis Eleven and Louisville City FC. As aluded above, this clash of titans is the cause for humanity&lsquo;s ascension to control this planet. Much like Bill &amp; Ted, this rivalry has spanned the ages and will some day bring peace to the world&hellip; once they learn to play guitar. While sporting celebs will tell you grand tales of Worldly Cups or Superb Owls, only the LIPAFC will tug your heartstrings like a puppy and tear you apart like finding out what happened to Bambiâ€™s mom.</p>
